# Creating an AST

In this chapter, we will see how to create an AST using the `auto_lsp` crate.

Any AST is created in two main steps:

- Write the query to capture the nodes you are interested in.
- Define the corresponding AST structures in Rust.

There is no specific order to follow; you can perform both steps in parallel.

In the next chapter, we will explore how to write the core query to capture the nodes.
